Installation
============

The recommended way to install `Unicorn` is using `Composer`.
Run the following command in your project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require xynnn/unicorn

This requires you to have `Composer` installed globally, as explained
in the installation_ chapter of the `Composer` documentation.
